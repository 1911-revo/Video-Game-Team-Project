      make you an offer. There\u2019s a spot as a lieutenant here, where you can
      serve as my personal assistant. Or, if you\u2019re game for something more
      adventurous, I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s an opening in the special forces
      branch for someone with your talents. Either choice is a promotion with increased
      responsibility and pay, but if you shine in the face of danger there could
      be big things for you in the future of this organisation. What\u2019ll it be?"
