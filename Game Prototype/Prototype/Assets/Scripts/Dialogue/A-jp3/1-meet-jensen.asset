    text: Oh, I guess I need to apologise and clarify a little bit... It's just my
      personal habits with talking with others. You see all of us are involved in
      this big experiment - the experiment called evolution. And I'm just interested
      in accelerating it as much as I can since I'm really curious about the destination
      of it.

    text: And J_ my friend, you are someone really special... Also your little friend
      Karl... Thinking about the meaning of existance is a symbol of self-awareness
      and self-awareness is the first step for improving yourself in any directions.
      In other words, it makes you become 'better', biologically or mentally.
